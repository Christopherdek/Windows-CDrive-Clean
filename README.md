<p>

</p>


<p>
Whenever you delete a file by 'right-clicking' 'delete' or hitting the 'delete' key on
your keyboard, it does not remove the files from your computer, the deleted files remain in your recycle bin until a default limit, for Windows 10 the recycle bin limit is around 50 GBs. 
</p>
<br />
<p>
Open your recycle bin and select 'cntrl + a' then ' 'shift + delete' to delete a file from your computer.
</p>
<br />
<p>
If you donâ€™t clean up your recycle bin frequently it will acquire a good amount of space out of your C drive. At this point, you will see improvements on your C Drive space. There are a few more things that can still improve your CPU performance.
</p>
<br />
<p>
<h2>Step 3, Uninstall</h2>
</p>
<br />
<p>
Uninstall all the unwanted or rarely used software & programs from your computer, that are installed into your C Drive by default. By removing unwanted programs, you can free up a lot more space on your C Drive. 
</p>
<br />
<p>
Go to the 'start menu' and search 'uninstall', in the search result select 'add or remove programs'. 
</p>
